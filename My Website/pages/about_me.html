        I am Physics and Mathematics student at the University of Barcelona. Needless to say, my passion
        lies in the intersection between these two sciences. I am particularly driven towards
        the geometric description of physical theories, and also the possible game-changing applications
        of quantum computing.
      </p>

        One year ago, I joined a research group at <a href="https://www.crm.cat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRM</a> 
        that works on complex analysis. Our aim was to study the complex 
        exponential family and trascendental dynamics. It was a great experience to get my
        first toe into the pool of research.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I could not wait to join another group. But this time,
        I was looking for a more applied and interdisciplinary work. This led me to participate in
        a summer program at the <a href="https://www.irbbarcelona.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRB</a>,
        where I could apply my knowledge in Physics and Mathematics to solve biology-related problems.
        I had the pleasure of working in the <a href="https://www.irbbarcelona.org/en/research/molecular-modelling-and-bioinformatics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular Modelling and Bioinformatics</a> 
        group.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests are currently in the intersection between Mathematics and Physics, what
        is known as the field of <i>mathematical physics</i>. Many times, studying one system from the
        abstract point of view that is offered by mathematics can lead to great progress and
        advancements that would have otherwhise required formidable efforts to achieve. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this is a two-way street, since physics has helped create new mathematics in several
        occasions. Calculus is a rather old-fashioned example, but more modern physical theoris, like
        QFT, serve as a fruitful playground for the emergence of new mathematical concepts. I would encourage
        you to have a look at this <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-mystery-at-the-heart-of-physics-that-only-math-can-solve-20210610/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Quanta Magazine
        </a> article if you want more details. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the realm of science, I am absorbed by literature, especially ancient Greek
        and Roman. However, I also enjoy more recent works.
