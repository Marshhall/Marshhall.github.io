  <h2>Book Recommendations</h2>

    <!-- book -->
    <div class="book-box">
      <a href="#">Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms</a>
      <p>
        I fortunately knew this book from the awesome YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown. It has been essential
        for my development in mathematics. It has a wonderfully deep and intuitive way to convey difficult
        concepts.

    <div class="book-box">
      <a href="#">Visual Complex Analysis</a>
      <p>
        Just amazing. I have always been fond of explaining something visually if possible, it just
        sticks for much longer. I would supplement this book with others, since it is also important
        to learn the formal details of this discipline. Ahlfors or Conway are among the best options.

    <!-- book -->    
    <div class="book-box">
      <a href="#">Visual Differential Geometry and Forms</a>
      <p>
        Written by the same author as Visual Complex analysis. Just amazing. Again, I would not use this
        book as the only reference to learn differential geometry, but it provides useful insights and
        intuition on the subject. To get more into the formal weeds, take a look at do Carmo's book.
