        I am a fourth-year Physics and Mathematics student at University of Barcelona. I am
        very interested in differential geometry, dynamical systems and their
        relation with physical systems, especially with quantum mechanics and electodynamics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last summer I joined a research group in complex analysis to study the complex 
        exponential family and trascendental dynamics. It was a great experience to get my
        first toe into the pool of research.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests are currently in the intersection between mathematics and physics, What
        is known as the field of mathematical physics. Many times, studying one system from the
        abstract point of view that is offered by mathematics can lead to great progress and
        advancements that would have otherwhise required formidable efforts to achieve. However,
        this is a two-way street, since physics has helped create new mathematics in several
        occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving the realm of science, I am absorbed by literature, especially ancient Greek
        and Roman. However, I also enjoy more recent works.
