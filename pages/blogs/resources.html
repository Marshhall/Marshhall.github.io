        This is a list of resources I have found very useful
        during my time at university. They are mostly books I
        have enjoyed or amazing websites to learn new things.

        I was lucky to find this book through the awesome YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3Blue1Brown</a>. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel what it feels like to do math. 
        It has a unique and wonderfully deep and intuitive way to convey difficult concepts.

        Just amazing. I have always been fond of explaining something visually if possible, it just
        sticks for much longer. I would supplement this book with others, since it is also important
        to learn the formal details of this discipline. Ahlfors or Conway are among the best options.

        Written by the same author as Visual Complex analysis. Just amazing. Again, I would not use this
        book as the only reference to learn differential geometry, but it provides useful insights and
        intuition on the subject. To get more into the formal weeds, take a look at the next book.

        </a>
        <h5>by John M. Lee</h5>
      </div>
      <p>
        One of the clearest routes into differential geometry: clean definitions, strong structure, and lots of guidance.
        Great as a serious "learn it properly" reference that still reads well.

        A beautiful view of classical mechanics through geometry and with the guidance of one of my favorite authors.

        Another one from the genius of Arnold. Short, sharp, and concept-driven. More like "how to think about ODEs" than a catalog of techniques. 
        Great for intuition and qualitative understanding.

        I do not even know where to start. Genius! These lectures are full of insights, and will help you
        understand concepts from the ground up. Feyman makes difficult concepts feel almost obvious sometimes,
        and just for this reason, it's worth it. However, he also knows how to get deep into the mathematics of it 
        when needed.

        This is the best introduction to special relativity I have ever seen, and with great problems too! The human-crow interaction
        will forever be one of my favorites methods of teaching. One of the best "learn by thinking" books in the subject.

        A classic for learning quantum mechanics with real mathematical backbone.
        Strong explanations, lots of worked reasoning, and a very "complete course" feel. I also enjoyed
        the discussion on the postulates of QM. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/physicsmemes/comments/1jy6ffa/brother_kept_it_real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Shankar himself introducing the subject!</a>

      <p>
        IMO, this book does a wonderful job providing physical intuition for phenomena in QM. For instance, the addition of
        angular momenta or the effects of the symmetries of the wave function in terms of how close (in space) can two particles be.
        Really nice when you want the "physics landscape" and lots of concrete examples.

        Just amazing. He has three series, mainly on Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, and Waves.
        If you are struggling with some <em>elementary</em> (as a synonym for fundamental, not easy),
        or just for fun, then you should definitely check them out.
