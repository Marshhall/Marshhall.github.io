        This is a list of resources I have found very useful
        during my time at university. They are mostly books I
        have enjoyed or amazing websites to learn new things.

        Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms
      </a>
      <h5>by John Hubbard and Barbara Burke Hubbard</h5>
      <p>
        I fortunately knew this book from the awesome YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown. It has been essential
        for my development in mathematics. It has a wonderfully deep and intuitive way to convey difficult
        concepts.

        Visual Complex Analysis
      </a>
      <h5>by Tristan Needham</h5>
      <p>
        Just amazing. I have always been fond of explaining something visually if possible, it just
        sticks for much longer. I would supplement this book with others, since it is also important
        to learn the formal details of this discipline. Ahlfors or Conway are among the best options.

      <p>
        Written by the same author as Visual Complex analysis. Just amazing. Again, I would not use this
        book as the only reference to learn differential geometry, but it provides useful insights and
        intuition on the subject. To get more into the formal weeds, take a look at do Carmo's book.

        The Feynman Lectures on Physics
      </a>
      <h5>by Richard P. Feynman (and others)</h5>
      <p>
        I do not even know where to start. Genius! These lectures are full of insights, and will help you
        understand concepts from the ground up. Feyman makes difficult concepts feel almost obvious sometimes,
        and just for this reason, it's worth it. However, he also knows how to get deep into the mathematics of it 
        when needed.

        Lectures by Walter Lewin
      </a>
      <p>
        Just amazing. He has three series, mainly on Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, and Waves.
        If you are struggling with some <em>elementary</em> (as a synonym for fundamental, not easy),
        or just for fun, then you should definitely check them out.

          Introduction to Electrodynamics

        <h5>by David J. Griffiths</h5>
        <p>
          In this book, Griffiths brilliantly conveys both the intuitive and formal aspects of electromagnetism.
          If you are looking for a gentle, useful, and robust introduction to this topic, then this is
          your book.
